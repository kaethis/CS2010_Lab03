Notes (Optional):		- I apologize this assignment is so late; I've had a
				  bit of a rough week, and I kinda let it get away
				  away on me. Hopefully the final product was worth
				  its tardiness. :[
				- In case you're wondering, I used the program FIGlet
				  to generate the text for the header, Lose_Scenario,
				  and Win_Scenario.
